django CMS plugin that shows content between specified times

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is at https://djangocms-timer.readthedocs.org.

Quickstart
----------

Install djangocms-timer::

    pip install djangocms-timer


Features
--------

Shows and hides child plugins according to the timers set in the plugin instance.

Caveats
-------

In its current form, plugin won't save you from the queries to retrieve child
plugins due to the way plugin rendering works in django CMS. Still, the
``render`` method of child plugins is not executed (and grandchildren plugins
are not retrieved) with mitigating effect on performance hit.
